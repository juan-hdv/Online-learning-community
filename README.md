## INTRODUCTION
#### Description

An skillshare.com / Udemy.com like online learning community and selling online courses, that will allow users to browse course catalog, filter courses by categories, search for courses, see courses details, add/delete courses to/from a shopping cart, include course adds to orders, give rates and reviews, check ratings and reviews from other users and, finally, checkout orders in the shopping cart.

##### Technologies
Python, Django, JavaScript - ECMAScript 6 (ES6), HTML, and CSS.

#### General Capston project requirements (from CS50)

- Sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (not based on the old Pizza project), and more complex than those.
- Utilize Django on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
- Mobile-responsive.
- Include a README.md (this file) describing the project.
- Provide a requirements.txt file with required Python packages.


## PROJECT DETAILS


### Implemented requirements

0. Authentication: allow user to login and logout the site.
1. Show course catalog.
2. Filter courses by multiple categories.
3. Filter courses by a filter string. Filter string is searched into the course’s titles and descriptions.
4. Show course details and prepare an order with course adds. Some of the adds are charged, some others are free.
5. Add an order to the shopping cart. An Order includes course, selected adds (some free some charged), items prices and total price.
6. Show orders in the shopping cart and an icon with the number of selected courses (if any).
7. Give course ratings/reviews and show course ratings average/reviews.
8. Authorization: Make course catalog available for non-signed in users and shopping cart available only for signed in users.
9. Paypal payment integration.

### Future improvement requirements ideas

1. Check payed orders. List orders already payed.
2. Upload images for course catalog.
3. Extend Users information for users relationship management.
4. Complement payment cycle with other Paypal capabilities and offer another Payment Gateways.
5. Improve the Admin module experience when updating tables with one to many relationships. For example, allow including course adds directly from the Course table in admin page.

### Project personal experience

It has been hard work and at the same time very enriching.

I have encountered great difficulties especially in the integration with Paypal, particularly due to the lack of good  documentation. I've wasted lot of time on outdated documents.

Thanks to the development of the Capstone project, I have learned and deepened especially in the following topics:

**Django**
- The models: handle the inherited abstract User model; the need to make methods within the model classes; the aggregation functions; using "related_name" for one to many relationships (foreign) and for many to many relatioships (QuerySets and entry_set); using class META to define constrains.
- Exporting settings variables for templates.
- Defining a urls (routes) for GET method with parameters and at the same time for POST methods without parameters.
- REST call to external APIs through requests.
- Use of custom HTTP error pages.
- Creating personalized template Tags.

**Python**
- Operations on strings.
- Dictionaries and Sets operations.
- Find / deccode strings Base64 (Interesting).

**Javascript**
- Use of operations on the DOM and manage events.
- Use of FETCH to call own and external APIs.

**HTML**
- Intensive use of Boostrap.
- Use of cloudflare font-awesome icons.
- Using modal dialogs (Bootstrap).

**CSS**
- Use of the SCSS language.

## RUNNING APP in Ubuntu
### Create an Enviroment

 Before running a project, an Environment must be set for Python 3 and requirements.txt must be then installed
 For example to create an environment called: /env-py3.9

 First create directory:

	mkdir env-py3.9

 Then set environment:

 	python3 -m venv env-py3.9

Finally, activate envirinment:

	source env-py3.9/bin/activate

Now is time time install Python packages - If requirements.txt is present:

	pip install requests

I have created an environment called ```/env-py3.9```

### Prepare environment
	> source active.sh

	# Where active.sh is a file with 2 lines:
	source env-py3.9/bin/activate
	cd env-py3.9/pr*5*/pr*5
